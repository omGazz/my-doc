# 🛡️ Security Best Practices for Authentication APIs

## 🔐 1. HTTPS is mandatory
Never expose your API without HTTPS. All traffic must be encrypted.  
This is the first step to prevent **MITM (Man-In-The-Middle)** attacks.

---

## 🔑 2. Passwords and hashing
- Never store passwords in plain text.
- Use modern hashing algorithms like **bcrypt**, **argon2**, or **scrypt**.
- **Avoid using SHA256** or similar for passwords — they are not designed for this purpose.

---

## 👤 3. Token-based authentication
- Use **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** or **OAuth2**, depending on your needs.
- JWTs must be **signed** and have a **short expiration time**.
- If you use JWT:
  - Store tokens **in memory** or in an **HttpOnly cookie** (on the browser).
  - **Avoid `localStorage`** due to XSS vulnerability.

---

## 🔄 4. Refresh tokens
- Access tokens should expire quickly.
- Use a **long-lived refresh token** to obtain new access tokens.
- Refresh tokens must be handled with care:
  - Store only on secure servers.
  - **Rotate them periodically**.

---

## 🧱 5. Rate limiting and brute force protection
- Prevent unlimited login attempts with:
  - **Rate limiting**
  - **Account/IP lockout** after multiple failed login attempts.

---

## 🧾 6. Logging and audit trail
- Log logins and suspicious activity.
- **Never log passwords**.
- Logs help with security audits and incident response.

---

## 🪪 7. Two-Factor / Multi-Factor Authentication (2FA / MFA)
- Provide the option to enable **two-factor authentication**:
  - OTP via mobile apps (e.g., Google Authenticator)
  - Email verification
  - SMS (avoid if possible due to security concerns)

---

## 🌍 Public or Private API?

| Type                     | Considerations |
|--------------------------|----------------|
| **Public** (visible to anyone) | Acceptable, but **must be secured properly**. E.g., `/auth/login` can be public, but heavily protected. |
| **Private** (restricted to known clients) | More secure. Limit via IP allowlists, client IDs, API gateway, or firewall. Less flexible. |

> ✅ Endpoints like `/auth/login` can be public, but all other actions must require tokens/authorization.

---

## 🧩 Should you use an existing auth provider?

### ✅ Use a provider if:
- You want to **reduce risk and complexity**.
- You have **common auth needs**: login, social login, MFA, user management.
- You prefer not to worry about **scalability or security at scale**.

> Examples: **Auth0**, **Firebase Auth**, **Amazon Cognito**.

### ❌ Roll your own if:
- You have **custom or business-specific requirements**.
- You have a **tight budget** and want to avoid recurring costs.
- You need **full control** over the infrastructure and security.

> 💡 Auth0 or Firebase Auth are great to start with — you can always replace them later with a custom solution.

---

## 🎯 Conclusion
- If you want **maximum security**, faster time-to-market, and less maintenance: **use a third-party provider**.
- If you want **full control**, build it yourself — but only if you know what you're doing.
